# Artist_Recognition

Artist identification of fine art paintings is a challenging
problem primarily handled by art historians with extensive
training and expertise. Many previous works have explored
this problem by explicitly defining classification features.
We aim to train a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the
goal of identifying the artist of a painting as accurately and
precisely as possible. Additionally, we intend to perform multiple
experiments to explore and understand the learned repre-
sentation of our networks.
